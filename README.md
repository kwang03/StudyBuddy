## Configuration Settings

NA

## API Key

NA

## Reading the Code: 

I would recommend reading my code by going in the following order:

1. UserSettings.java
2. StudyBuddyActivity.java
3. TimerView.java
4. TimerStudyBuddyActivity.java
5. EvaluateAreaBuddyActivity.java
6. SettingsStudyBuddyActivity.java

It is important to note that TimerStudyBuddyActivity, EvaluateAreaBuddyActivity and SettingsStudyBuddyActivity all extend from StudyBuddyActivity.


## Other information

When the study time runs out, a new timer with the break time starts and there is some new behavior of that screen. If you don't want to wait it out to see it you can change the DEFAULT_STUDY_TIME value in UserSettings.java to something small like 1000 to quickly see it
